EPIC:
I want a search engine to provide me with websites related to my search

STORY:
I would like to...
-see ten search results
-have an 'i'm feeling lucky' button
-have a home button to navigate
-use the search engine on my laptop and smartphone


PROGRESS AFTER DAY 1

HTML and CSS was created for our home page and results page.

Following this we created app.js and main.js to create routes and a server.

We have managed to gather the data entered into the search bar.

OBJECTIVES FOR TOMORROW ARE

-restyling out search bar and logos

-adding and home button in the header

readjusting the breakpoints to common device dimensions

-researching a new API to use as the google API appears to be problematic due to 'search engine ID' required

-changing the results page into and ejs file
